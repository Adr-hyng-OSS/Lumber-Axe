ü™ì Lumber axe is an addon that chops a whole tree of connected blocks of logs down with just a single break at any side of the connected block of log. This accurately chops the whole tree down with the power of Minecraft Bedrock's Experimental Features.

##### **Note: Don't use the lumber axe tool to your valuable structures that has any type of logs in it, especially if the block of logs are connected.**
