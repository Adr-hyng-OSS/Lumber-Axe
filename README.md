ðŸª“ Lumber axe is an addon that chops a whole tree of connected blocks of logs down with just a single break at any side of the connected block of log. This accurately chops the whole tree down with the power of Minecraft Bedrock's Experimental Features.

##### **Note: Don't use the lumber axe tool to your valuable structures that has any type of logs in it, especially if the block of logs are connected.**

<h1 align="center" > <strong> ðŸŽ® Installation ðŸŽ® </strong> </h1>
There are 2 ways you can install this addon to your device.

## *Pocket Edition: (WIP: imgs)*

- You can directly install or import the addon through importing or installing it as mcaddon format to the Minecraft Pocket / Bedrock Edition.

- You can rename the .mcaddon to ".zip" and extract it as folder, then copy the folder into the Minecraft -> Behavior Packs (directory). There you can restart your minecraft, and see your behavior pack in game.

## *Windows Edition: (WIP: imgs)*

- After downloading the `Behavior Pack` and `Resource Pack` in `.mcpack` or `.mcaddon` form, open it by selecting *Minecraft: Windows Edition* as the application: <br> > It will automatically install the `Behavior Pack & Resource Pack` if you opened the `.mcaddon` file. <br> > It will automatically install `Behavior Pack` if you installed the **v1.20.0-Lumber_Axe_BP.mcpack**, and **v1.20.0-Lumber_Axe_BP.mcpack** for `Resource Pack`.
- After installing both packs, you can add it to your own world with few setup to work with In-game.

## *In-Game: (WIP : imgs)*

Make sure you **TURN ON** the following features or capabilities in the game:

- Holiday Creator Features
- GameTest Framework
